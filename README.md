# inferring_effective_couplings_with_RBMs
Code for the paper *Inferring effective couplings with Restricted Boltzmann Machines* by Aur√©lien Decelle, Cyril Furtlehner, Beatriz Seoane and Alfonso Navas. 

This repo is exclusively dedicated to the numerical implementation of the mapping between the energy function of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and an effective Ising spin Hamiltonian that includes high-order interactions between spins. So, we will delve neither into the generation of Ising model samples nor the training of the models.
